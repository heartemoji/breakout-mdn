# Breakout 
Result of the MDN tutorial on HTML5 canvas and javascript game making.
### Possible Improvements Beyond the Tutorial
- Separating javascript and CSS into different files
- Add a collision sound for each collision the ball makes 
- Make a proper web page around the canvas
- When the user misses a ball and the game ends, it sometimes takes multiple refreshes to restart the game
- Add a start button so that the game does not start immediately on page load
