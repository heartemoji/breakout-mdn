# Breakout 
Result of the MDN tutorial on HTML5 canvas and javascript game making. The tutorial took me as far as the very base game functionality. Below I have outlined features I have
either added or am planning to add.
### Additional Features
- Collision sound on brick contact

### Possible Improvements Beyond the Tutorial
- Separating javascript and CSS into different files
- Make a proper web page around the canvas
- When the user misses a ball and the game ends, it sometimes takes multiple refreshes to restart the game
- Add a start button so that the game does not start immediately on page load
